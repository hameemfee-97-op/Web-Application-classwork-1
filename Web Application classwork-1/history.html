      <h2>History of Dhaka as a Capital</h2>
      <p>
        Dhaka has a rich and layered history that spans centuries. It was first mentioned in historical records during the 7th century. 
        However, Dhaka rose to prominence in the early 17th century when the Mughal Empire made it the capital of Bengal in 1608 under Subahdar Islam Khan. 
        It was then known as Jahangirnagar, named after the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. As a Mughal capital, the city became a center of trade, administration, 
        and culture, famous for its fine muslin textiles.

      <p>
        After the fall of the Mughals, Dhaka lost its capital status during British colonial rule. The British shifted the administrative center to Calcutta (now Kolkata). 
        However, in 1905, during the first partition of Bengal, Dhaka was made the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. This status lasted until 1911 
        when the partition was annulled.

      <p>
        Dhaka regained its importance in 1947 when the British left the Indian subcontinent. With the creation of Pakistan, Dhaka became the capital 
        of East Pakistan. It remained so until 1971, when Bangladesh gained independence after the Liberation War. Since then, Dhaka has been the capital 
        of the sovereign nation of Bangladesh.

      <p>
        <strong>In total, Dhaka has served as a capital city four times:</strong><br>
        1. Capital of Bengal under the Mughals (1608–1704)<br>
        2. Capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam (1905–1911)<br>
        3. Capital of East Pakistan (1947–1971)<br>
        4. Capital of independent Bangladesh (1971–present)
